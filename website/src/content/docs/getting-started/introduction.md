## The Problem

Starting a new service means making dozens of decisions upfront: project layout, error handling, logging, config, middleware, database setup, graceful shutdown. You either copy-paste from a previous project (carrying its tech debt) or spend hours setting up boilerplate before writing a single line of business logic.

Then, three months later, every team's service looks different.

## The Solution

Archway is an **architecture-aware service composer**. Instead of monolithic templates, it composes your project from two building blocks:

1. **Architecture** — The structural pattern (hexagonal, flat) that defines your project layout and dependency rules
2. **Capabilities** — 38 modular features (HTTP API, MySQL, auth, circuit breaker, i18n, etc.) that plug into your architecture

```
Architecture (hexagonal) + Capabilities (http-api, mysql, docker) = Your Service
```

<Aside type="tip">
Think of it like Terraform for code architecture. You declare what you want, Archway composes it.

## What Makes It Different

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Composable, not monolithic" icon="puzzle">
    Pick only what you need. No unused code, no dead imports. 38 capabilities across 8 categories.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architecture enforcement" icon="approve-check-circle">
    `archway check` validates dependency rules with 11 AST-based detectors. Domain code importing adapter code? Caught.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart suggestions" icon="star">
    Adding an HTTP API? Archway suggests rate limiting, CORS, and authentication. 18 suggestion rules with cross-referencing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production patterns built in" icon="setting">
    RFC 7807 errors, structured logging, PII redaction, graceful shutdown, OpenTelemetry — all wired correctly from day one.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Who Is It For

- **Teams** starting new microservices who want consistent structure across projects
- **Individual developers** who want production-grade defaults without the setup time
- **Organizations** that want to enforce architectural standards across their Go services

## Language Support

| Language | Status | Architectures | Capabilities |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Go** | Stable | hexagonal, flat | 38 capabilities |
| **TypeScript/Node** | Planned | — | — |

Archway is built on a **provider model** — each language is a self-contained provider with its own architectures, capabilities, and templates. The composition model, smart suggestions, and `archway check` work identically across all languages.

## What It Is Not

- **Not a framework** — generates plain code with no runtime dependency
- **Not opinionated about your business logic** — it sets up the infrastructure, you write the domain
- **Not a code generator that you run repeatedly** — scaffold once, own the code
